3. In the Pwershell terminal,  execute the script as below
>.\Filename.ps1

### Script 1: Backup a Directory
**Description**: This script copies all files from one directory to another as a backup.

```powershell
# Variables for source and destination paths
$sourcePath = "C:\MyDocuments"
$backupPath = "D:\Backup\MyDocuments"

# Ensure the backup directory exists
if (-not (Test-Path $backupPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
}

# Copy all items from source to backup
Copy-Item -Path "$sourcePath\*" -Destination $backupPath -Recurse
```

**Explanation**: The script checks if the backup directory exists, and if not, it creates the directory. Then, it copies all files from the source directory to the backup directory.

### Script 2: Log Running Processes
**Description**: This script logs the currently running processes to a file.

```powershell
# Get the current date and time
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"

# Define the log file path
$logFilePath = "C:\Logs\ProcessLog_$timestamp.txt"

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
if (-not (Test-Path "C:\Logs")) {
    New-Item -Path "C:\Logs" -ItemType Directory
}

# Get running processes and output to the log file
Get-Process | Out-File -FilePath $logFilePath
```

**Explanation**: This script captures the current processes and logs them into a file named with the current timestamp. It also ensures the log directory exists before writing the log.

### Script 3: Start a Specific Service if Not Running
**Description**: This script checks if a specific service (e.g., "Spooler") is running and starts it if it's not.

```powershell
# Specify the service name
$serviceName = "Spooler"

# Get the service status
$service = Get-Service -Name $serviceName

# Check if the service is not running
if ($service.Status -ne "Running") {
    Start-Service -Name $serviceName
    Write-Output "$serviceName service started."
} else {
    Write-Output "$serviceName service is already running."
}
```

**Explanation**: This script checks the status of the specified service and starts it if it's not already running.

### Script 4: Clean Up Old Log Files
**Description**: This script deletes all `.log` files older than 30 days from a specified directory.

```powershell
# Specify the directory containing log files
$logDirectory = "C:\Logs"

# Get log files older than 30 days
$oldLogs = Get-ChildItem -Path $logDirectory -Filter *.log | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) }

# Remove old log files
foreach ($log in $oldLogs) {
    Remove-Item -Path $log.FullName
    Write-Output "Deleted $($log.FullName)"
}
```

**Explanation**: This script finds and deletes all log files in the specified directory that are older than 30 days.

### Script 5: Generate a List of Installed Services and Their Statuses
**Description**: This script generates a report of all installed services and their statuses and saves it to a file.

```powershell
# Define the output file path
$outputFile = "C:\Reports\ServicesStatus.txt"

# Get the list of services and their statuses
Get-Service | Select-Object Name, Status | Out-File -FilePath $outputFile

# Output a confirmation message
Write-Output "Service status report generated at $outputFile"
```

**Explanation**: This script retrieves all services and their current statuses, then saves this information to a text file.
